Berkelium extension for Kivy
============================

Berkelium is a BSD licensed library for offscreen rendering via Chromium
project. Check http://berkelium.org/ for more information about it. We are using
a patched version of Berkelium, available at https://github.com/tito/berkelium
(branch chromium8-alternate-bin)


Notes
-----

	- This extension require Kivy 1.0.7 !
	- This extension is under development. It's actually working and tested
	  only for Linux 64 bits.
	- MacOSX can't be supported at the moment, since Kivy require Python
	  64bits, and Chromium can't be built under 64bits on MacOSX.
